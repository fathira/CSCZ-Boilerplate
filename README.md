# CSCZ-Boilerplate
### Our take on (now abandoned) CS-Cart Boilerplate theme based on HTML5 Twitter Bootstrap 3

This theme is, just like the original Boilerplate, meant for development. The goal is for it to be fully compatible with latest versions of CS-Cart (currently version 4.x). Keep an eye on the repository, there should be a usable release soon together with an example child theme.

## Installation
There are two ways to install the Boilerplate theme: via Git and from downloaded ZIP archive.

1. Go to a CS-Cart folder via this bash command:
